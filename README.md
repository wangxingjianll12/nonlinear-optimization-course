# nonlinear-optimization-course
- This repository is currently being used to host material for a Nonlinear Optimization Course. 

# To Do
- Update the HessVec product method in problem class LeastSquaresTukey.
- Update problem class LeastSquaresTurkey so that it can efficiently reuse computed quantities. 
- Update problem class Logistic so that it can efficiently reuse computed quantities.
- Update problem class LeastSquares so that it can efficiently reuse computed quantities.
- Update entire problem structure so that each problem has a fixed set of properties such as m, n, obj_type, etc.  Use inheritance.
- Add more unconstrained problems from CUTEr.
- Add *equality* constrained problems from CUTEr.
